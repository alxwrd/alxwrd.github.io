For a long time, chess was believed to be a game that only humans could play. We
now know that this is not the case, and chess engines will beat human players
without much trouble. In the world of software, a similar tale is unfolding as
AI coding agents outproduce even the most [wired-in developers][1].


### Bad code, good software

As we enter 2026, a debate rages on - and both sides are shouting past each
other. On one side: code _can_ be written by AI, but what it produces is
steaming-hot garbage. On the other side: [Ralph Wiggum][2] is on an all-night
reckless `--dangerously-skip-permissions` bender. The hype is real, and I find
myself flip-flopping between them. Both sides are right: coding agents can
produce hot-garbage, but maybe that doesn't matter, and 'good enough' is good
enough?


Unlike chess, which has a winner, software is more nuanced. Yes, you can write
"bad code" - but what is 'bad'? Buggy and slow, sure. But is code that completes
its task bad? [Undertale](https://undertale.com) infamously has [one giant
switch statement][3] for its dialog system - while to date it has sold over 5
million copies. Yes, 'real' developers may turn their nose up, but the code
achieved its purpose.


Undertale is proof that the conventionally 'right' way doesn't matter when
producing successful software - and I'm sure there are many more examples across
all industries that demonstrate the same. Likewise, in chess, the engines have a
tendency to [play 'weird' moves][4]. These moves on the surface look strange to
a human - but lead to successful positions.


I wonder if this might be the future for our coding agents. By allowing our
agents to produce 'bad' code that doesn't follow typical aesthetic or design
choices, can we still produce successful software? I'm optimistic about an
agentic future, and I regularly let coding agents take a first pass at a
feature - but I can't help having a 'tidy' pass to improve aesthetic and human
readability.


### 'People code'

There is also a strange tension where the 'game' of software is being pushed
aside because of coding agents. The people who enjoy the game of software are
having their identity challenged because a machine can now do what they love.
Professional chess players still exist and play 'people chess' because there's
still beauty - and money - in it. 'People code' might still be beautiful, but is
there still money in it?


Software can be enjoyable like a game, but mostly it's business - and the
problem with business is the thing we're optimising for is market efficiency.
Craft-focused teams and artisanal software sound appealing but the extra time
(and therefore money) required will push us to "good enough" agent code. Even
teams that value craft may not be able to afford it.


Software is rarely art - even if well crafted code _feels_ special - it is a
means to an end. If generated code is 80% as clean but 3x as fast to produce,
market pressure will decide the winner.


Ultimately, coding agents won't eliminate 'people code', just like chess engines
didn't eliminate 'people chess'. But we won't be able to enjoy the craft as much
during our 9-5's. There will still be times where we roll up our sleeves and
work at a problem ourselves, but it will probably after our agents have messed
something up again.

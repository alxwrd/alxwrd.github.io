# ASUS DSL-AC68U

## Cron jobs

It's possible to schedule a [[cron]] job on the ASUS router using the
command `cru`.

### Add a new cron job

```plain
cru a {id} min hour day month week command
```

### List cron jobs

```plain
cru l
```

### Delete cron job

```plain
cru d {id}
```

### Reboots

One issue with cron jobs is `/var` is volatile storage, so will
be erased after a reboot. `/jffs` is persistant storage.
A work around for this is to insert a USB into the router,
and set run on mount script.

```shell
nvram set script_usbmount="/jffs/scriptname"
nvram commit
```

```shell
#!/bin/sh
cp /jffs/<admin user name> /var/spool/cron/crontabs
```

```shell
chmod +x scriptname
```

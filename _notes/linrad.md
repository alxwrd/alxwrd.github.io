## Getting started

To get started with [Linrad](http://www.sm5bsz.com/linuxdsp/linrad.htm)
download the [installer](http://www.sm5bsz.com/linuxdsp/archive/setup-linrad-04.14a.exe).
Once installed, Linrad will need DLL's for the devices you intend to use with
it. The DLL's can be found [here](http://www.sm5bsz.com/dll.htm). It's easiest
to install them all using the installer.

### First time setup
> There is a [newcomer guide](http://www.sm5bsz.com/linuxdsp/usage/newco/newcomer.htm)
> available which goes into lots more detail.

Once installed, on the first run of Linrad you will be prompted with some
setup instructions. 

```plain
        Press one of the following keys:

'N' for NEWCOMER mode.
'S' for normal mode.
'E' for expert mode.

Then Press ENTER 
```

Newcomer mode turns off some options once in the program and simplifies the
rest of the setup and is the best to get started.

```plain
You can specify the screen size in pixels or as a percentage
of the entire area of all your screens. Enter Y for sizes in
pixels or N for sizes as % (Y/N)=>n

Percentage of screen width to use(25 to 100):
=>75

Percentage of screen height to use(25 to 100):
=>75
```

Next is screen size. Linrad runs in a window, and while the window can be
resized, the rendered content is not. Percentage is a bit easier, but choose
whichever.

After, you will be presented with main Linrad program. Press <kbd>W</kbd> to
save the setup configuration.
